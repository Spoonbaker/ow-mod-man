        Thank you for suggesting a theme for the manager!
        If you need inspiration or help with choosing colors, I recommend [Real-Time Colors](https://realtimecolors.com) (Secondary is called accent on that site)

        ## Where each color is used

        Primary:
        - Start Game Button
        - Version Chip
        - Complete download progress bar
        - Any CTA button (e.g. Submit, Install, Save, etc.)
        - Selected input fields

        Secondary:
        - Selected tab (the little line)
        - In-progress download progress bar
  - type: input
    id: primary
    attributes:
      label: Primary Color
      description: The primary color of the theme (Start game button, version chip color, etc.) (Hex format preferred)
      placeholder: "#000000"
  - type: input
    id: secondary
    attributes:
      label: Secondary Color
      description: The secondary color of the theme (The selected tab color, the download progress bar color, etc) (Hex format preferred)
      placeholder: "#000000"
